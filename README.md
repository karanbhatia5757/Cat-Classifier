# Cat-Classifier
This repository contains code and datasets for simple cat image classification.<br/>
The code is written in python and uses numpy package. Python notebook (.ipynb) file contains the code.<br/>
To classify cats from images, simple logistic regression classifier is used. The accuracy achieved on test set is approximately  70% and that on training set is 99.04%. This is the case of overfitting as the classifier ovrfits the training set.<br/>
Though the accuracy on test set is very low, it's ok as dataset is small and very simple classifier is used.
